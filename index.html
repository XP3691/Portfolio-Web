	   <h2><p>Step 1: Modeling The Car</p></h2>
    <p>In the beginning, this project was all about learning how to properly model vehicles. <br> 
	After some trial and error, I finally landed on this Dodge Challenger Hellcat, my fourth car model.<br>
	To start i picked out a blueprint and set it up in my scene so all the orthographic <br>
	views are properly lined up.</p>

    <p>Next I started work on a low poly version of the car. After i was done i applied subdivision and smooth modifiers.</p>

  </div>
   <div class="project-text">
   <p>Lastly I started working on all the car components that had to be sepparately attached, <br> 
   i aslo turend the single mesh into multiple car panels to give it a more detailed and complex look<br>
   (this part also includes all details on the side of the car).</p>

	   <h2><p>Step 2: Making the scene</p></h2>
    <p>After Finishing the Vehicle i wanted to create a proper scene to showcase the model. I am presonally <br>
	a huge fan of surreal scenes, especially the ones that include a mundane item. After some trial i <br>
	landed on the concept of an underwater scene with the car floating in the middle.</p>

	   <h2><p>Step 3: Volumetrics & Lighting</p></h2>
    <p>Once Everything was put in place it was time to add lighting and mood to the scene, <br>
	as the scene takes place underwater it required caustics for the lighting i achieved <br>
	this by creating a transparent plane with a voronoi and displacement map on it.<br>
	For the lighting i used a spotlight with extremely high luminosity to simulate <br>
	sunlight and to create the foggy water effect i used a volumetric modifier on a texture </p>

	   <h2><p>Part 1 The Gameplay. </p></h2>
    <p>The Assignment consisted of creating a game that showcased our understadning of both <br> 
	visible and invisible game design components, for this i decided to create a 3d movement <br> 
	platformer with a look that reminds the player of the PsX era games.</p>

      <h2>Movement Tech: Wallrunning</h2>
      <div class="project-row">

        <img src="images/WallrunningUnlock.gif" alt="Detailed image 1" />

        <div class="text-box">
          <p>The Player is taught to interact very early on, once they reach this part of the sublevel<br>
		  they wont be able to progress without unlocking the wallrunning ability by ineracting with the<br>
		  computer in front, in case they try to continue the walls do not have collision and the player<br>
		  will fall through.</p>

          <p>Once Unlocked, The Player Will be able to run on the Yellow colored walls around <br>

        <div class="text-box">
          <p>The level is designed in a way that they will most likely find the wallrunning sublevel first <br>
		  and if they do not they will run into a roadblock regardless as they lack the ability to interact<br>
		  with the yellow walls. Once this is completed however they will most likely have collected at least <br>
		  50 CD collectibles which allows them to buy the grappling block at the ATM which then allows them to <br>
		  grapple on purple BLocks </p>

	   <h2><p>Part 2 Level Design. </p></h2>
    <p>The level is structured in a semi linear way, the collectibles push the player in a certain <br>
	direction but on closer inspection one can find small hidden spots, and extra rewards. As mentioned <br>
	before the layout leads the player to normally find the entrance to the Sublevel (platforming section)<br>
	first, in case they dont there is only limited spaces to visit and the circular map brings the player <br>
	back to the sublevel at some point in case they skip it.</p>
